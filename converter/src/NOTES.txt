Active Blocks (in progress):
        # activeBlocks.bin
        ConcurrentHashMap<SBlock, Integer>
            SBlock has coords and respawn material
            Integer is respawn time


Placed Blocks:
       # placedBlocks.bin
       ConcurrentHashMap<SBlock, Integer>
           SBlock has coords, material is always AIR
           Integer is always zero

Locked Blocks:
       # lockedBlocks.bin?
       ConcurrentHashMap<SBlock, Integer>
           SBlock has coords, material is always AIR
           Integer is always zero

Regions File:
       # regions.bin
       RegionSet
       - Must use getRegionNames() to get the names (returns ArrayList<String>)
       - then use getRegion(String name) to get individual region
       - then get the corner points: region.getLocation() -> array of int
            {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2}
